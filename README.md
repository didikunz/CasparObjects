# CasparObjects
Library to control CasparCG Server.

This library can be used to control CasparCG from a .NET app under Windows. 
I use it for all my client and always, when I need new functionality I add something to it.
It is not very object oriented, but mostly a wrapper around CasparCG's AMCP commands. 
Most functions have multiple sigantures, so that you can choose which one to use.
